1,Mike,Richter,Mike Richter,Sr. Consultant & Director of Analytics,Charter Solutions,Community Banking Analytics: A Case Study to Approaches in Customer & Product Line Profitability Analysis,http://linkedin.com/in/mike-richter-621233,B,"Small community banks are feeling the competitive squeeze from larger banking organizations. For years, they have been successful by relying on selling the same products to a largely rural customer base. But now, with increased competition from larger banks having more creative marketing techniques and internal analytics capabilities, they are struggling to keep pace. Revenue growth has slowed and margins are beginning to shrink.  They are starting to second-guess whether they are selling the right products and whether they really understand their customer base anymore. Understanding product line and customer profitability in banking can drive strategic & tactical activities and it begins with knowing which products are the most & least profitable, and which customers own these products. How can small banks leverage analytics to gain insights into customer and product line profitability?  Where is the best place to get started?  What can they accomplish with limited internal resources? Learn how a small family-owned community banking organization approached this challenge and what they were able to accomplish in a short period of time. ",Minnesota Room,3:15 PM,4:00 PM

Local commercial real estate reps and brokers provided individual market insights and guided location decisions in those early days along with a heavy dose of the company's street smarts, gut instinct and entrepreneurial risk. As the need to open stores at a quicker pace and grow outside its early regional footprints arose, the company began experimenting with various GIS and demographic data system to add a sense of speed to the decision_making process and provide relativity to the new markets and sites. These systems improved the speed of data delivery but did not add much to the accuracy of projecting sales for new stores. At the same time, data delivery became more cumbersome and time consuming over time as more and more data was loaded into systems in an attempt to increase learning. Fast forward to today - NTE has taken its site and market analysis functions to the cloud. At present, systems are up and running. There is no more reliance on the speed of a desktop computer's C:\ drive and painstaking queries of our SAS data warehouse to answer site/market analysis questions. Questions that took days, maybe even a week to answer, are now forwarded to decision makers in a matter of hours or half days. New systems are quick and nimble while being available from any robust web connection making fieldwork much more meaningful in real time. Are the sales forecasts any more accurate?

In some cases, the missing data may be necessary. However, in many cases the selection of a different technique or a re-framing of the problem can lead to a viable solution using just the data on hand.

Using the firm's posts as a driver of engagement on its product pages on Facebook, we study the relationship between the style (i.e., formal vs. informal) and content (i.e., business related vs non-business related) of a given post submitted by a firm on its Facebook page and the level of user engagement measured as the number of positive and negative comments on the post. The analysis was conducted on 57000 posts from product pages of Fortune 1000 companies. The key finding from the analysis is that in the environment of Facebook all types of products generate greater engagement from informal posts; however, in the content dimension ""incongruous"" posts, i.e., posts that differ from the type of content that would be expected on a given product page, generate greater engagement. The analysis has important implications for how firms should engage with customers on Facebook based on the characteristics of their product.",Minnesota Room,1:30 PM,2:00 PM

It's the behavioral story of their journey and it's of immense value in optimizing the customer experience. In this session, we'll look at the underlying technologies, the type of data they create, the analytic methods that apply, and the parallels to digital that can make tackling in-store location analytics easier.
