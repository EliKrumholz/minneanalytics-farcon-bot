20,David,Drymon,David Drymon,Market Research Manager at Northern Tool & Equipment,Northern Tools,From Guts to Glory: The evolution on site selection at Northern Tools,https://www.linkedin.com/in/daviddrymon/,,"Long a catalog and web_based purveyor of tools, machinery and specialty products for the DIYer and farmer along with construction and contractor businesses large and small, Northern Tool & Equipment began operating stores in 1981 with the company’s founding. Local commercial real estate reps and brokers provided individual market insights and guided location decisions in those early days along with a heavy dose of the company’s street smarts, gut instinct and entrepreneurial risk. As the need to open stores at a quicker pace and grow outside its early regional footprints arose, the company began experimenting with various GIS and demographic data system to add a sense of speed to the decision_making process and provide relativity to the new markets and sites. These systems improved the speed of data delivery but did not add much to the accuracy of projecting sales for new stores. At the same time, data delivery became more cumbersome and time consuming over time as more and more data was loaded into systems in an attempt to increase learning. Fast forward to today – NTE has taken its site and market analysis functions to the cloud. At present, systems are up and running. There is no more reliance on the speed of a desktop computer’s C:\ drive and painstaking queries of our SAS data warehouse to answer site/market analysis questions. Questions that took days, maybe even a week to answer, are now forwarded to decision makers in a matter of hours or half days. New systems are quick and nimble while being available from any robust web connection making fieldwork much more meaningful in real time. Are the sales forecasts any more accurate?

In some cases, the missing data may be necessary. However, in many cases the selection of a different technique or a re-framing of the problem can lead to a viable solution using just the data on hand.

The analysis was conducted on 57000 posts from product pages of Fortune 1000 companies. The key finding from the analysis is that in the environment of Facebook all types of products generate greater engagement from informal posts; however, in the content dimension “incongruous” posts, i.e., posts that differ from the type of content that would be expected on a given product page, generate greater engagement. The analysis has important implications for how firms should engage with customers on Facebook based on the characteristics of their product.",3-432,9:00 AM,9:45 AM

39,Gary,Angel,Gary Angel,CEO,Digital Mortar,Surviving the Retail Apocalypse: Bringing Digital Methods to Physical Retail,https://www.linkedin.com/in/garyangel1,B,"Retails massive disruption is due – at least in part- to digital competition. And one of digital’s huge advantages is data and analytics. Digital is comprehensively measurable. And that measurement drives a discipline of testing and continuous improvement that has served the digital channel well. The same discipline can help optimize customer experiences in stores and on-location in any business. And taking advantage of that is critical to surviving today’s challenges. There are now technologies that provide measurement of the in-premise customer journey. Accurately and comprehensively. The data they create is remarkably similar to digital data. It’s the behavioral story of their journey and it’s of immense value in optimizing the customer experience. In this session, we’ll look at the underlying technologies, the type of data they create, the analytic methods that apply, and the parallels to digital that can make tackling in-store location analytics easier. This is a great introduction to the newest discipline of customer analytics and the techniques for bringing it to life and solving its unique challenges.",3-432,11:15 AM,12:00 PM

The ascent of Amazon and the corresponding descent of physical retail is attributed to the inherent advantages of the online medium. Everybody knows the apocalyptic conditions that physical retail is enduring during the 2016 - 2018 era.The seismic changes in physical retail are not a direct result of the physical medium; the changes in physical retail aren't even as seismic as popular viewpoints would indicate. New forms of physical retail are emerging and the space is transforming. The underlying forces operating in online and offline retail are deep and multi-layered -- their impact is more subtle and complex than the popular understanding portrays.No doubt that there are winners and losers in physical retail -- no doubt that the rate of winning and losing is accelerating. The consequences of winning are becoming ever more lucrative and the consequences of losing are becoming ever more ruthless. But distribution medium is not the determining factor. Agility and responsiveness in either medium is the determining factor. The old paradigm of ""sustainable"" advantage has given way to ""transient"" advantage. Winning in the era of transient advantage is based on agility and responsiveness -- agility and responsiveness, in turn, is based on customer centricity and analytical orientation / data centricity.In this session, we'll explore the true differences between success and failure in the modern retail arena and we'll clarify the keys to success under these conditions.",Auditorium,9:00 AM,9:45 AM
